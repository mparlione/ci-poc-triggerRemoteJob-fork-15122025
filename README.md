### Legend: Cross-Controller Pipeline Triggering Flow

#### Pipelines
* **Parent Pipeline**: The initiating pipeline script that loads a shared library and executes the `triggerRemoteJob` step to start a job on another controller.
* **Child Pipeline**: The target pipeline script that defines parameters (e.g., `paramKey1`) and executes steps when triggered by an upstream process.

#### Shared Library Functions & Steps
* **`triggerRemoteJob`**: A pipeline step used to trigger a job on a remote controller. It requires a `remotePathUrl` and can optionally take parameters via `parameterFactories`.
* **`getTargetInstanceID` (Shared Library `call` function)**: A function that takes a `controllerName` and `jobPath` as input. It uses `RemoteDirectory.walk` to resolve the path's instance ID and returns the fully constructed `jenkins://` URL needed to trigger the remote job.
* **`resolveInstanceId`**: A helper function annotated with `@NonCPS` designed to elevate privileges to `ACL.SYSTEM` to ensure visibility when resolving a remote controller path into an instance ID.

#### Key Concepts & Parameters
* **Remote URL Structure**: The specific URL format required by `triggerRemoteJob`, constructed as `jenkins://${resolvedPath.getInstanceId()}/${jobPath}`.
* **`parameterFactories`**: A list used within the triggering pipeline to define and pass parameters (names and values) to the remote job.
* **Pipeline Parameters**: Variables defined at the beginning of a pipeline (e.g., within a `parameters {}` block) that allow the pipeline to accept input values, such as strings defined with a default value and description.
* **`@NonCPS`**: An annotation required on certain methods (like those handling ACLs) to prevent serialization issues during pipeline execution.
